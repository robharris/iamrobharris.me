<p>Hi everyone and Welcome to the first part of The Division Beta game play.</p>
<p>I only got a few hours to play this, as (I am sure you know), there was a major fuck up with the beta, that stopped a lot of people who had pre-ordered the game (and had 'guaranteed access') from playing it. As I live in Australia, I only got the code to access the beta on Sunday.</p>
<p>Even though I didn't get as much time as I would have liked playing it, I think it is pretty good so far.</p>
<p>I do have to get used to the third person aspect of the game, as I am so used to shooting from first person, I start to shoot at someone and I am actually aiming when the character is looking, not where the crosshairs are.</p>
