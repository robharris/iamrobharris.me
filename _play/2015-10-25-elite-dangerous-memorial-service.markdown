## {{ page.heading }}

<p>Back in September CMDR Sataris, on the Elite Dangerous subreddit, posted a heart warming / heart-wrenching story about losing his mother and asking Frontier (the makers of Elite Dangerous) about a memorial to his mum. Here is the link to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3jdc2t/frontier_helped_me_out_after_mother_passed_away/" target="_blank">original reddit post</a>, so you can read the whole story, from CMDR Sataris himself.</p>
<p>The TL,DR is that CMDR Sataris asked Frontier if they could name a planet or system after his mother, as a memorial to her. Frontier obliged and renamed a planet in the BD+26 2184 system after her.</p>
<p>In October, CMDR Sataris organised a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3o1tph/memorial_service_at_bd26_2184_on_saturday_10102015/" target="_blank">memorial</a> trip to BD+26 2184 to visit the planet. I got there at 3 am AEST and jumped in and out of instances, hoping to bump into CMDR Sataris to pay my respects. Unfortunately, I never did get into an instance with him, but I paid my respects and took some screenshots of the planet.</p>
