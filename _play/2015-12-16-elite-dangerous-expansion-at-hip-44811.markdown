## {{ page.heading }}

<p>I am part of the Hudson faction in Elite Dangerous, and there was a call out on the Hudson <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteHudson" target="_blank">subreddit</a>, calling for all combat pilots to head to HIP 44811, to help with the expansion into the system.</p>
<p>This is some of the PVE I recorded while trying to help Hudson win the expansion.</p>
