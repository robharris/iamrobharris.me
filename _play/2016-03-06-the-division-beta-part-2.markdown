<p>Hi everyone and Welcome to the last part of The Division Beta.</p>
<p>As you can see I am still getting used to the third person aspect of the game. I thought I would get used to it quicker than I did, but it was still fun playing something different.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided not to keep this game, as there are other games coming during the year that I think I will enjoy more.</p>
