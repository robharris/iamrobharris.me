<p>It has been a while since I uploaded a video and I got very behind on my editing, so I thought the best thing to do would be to jump forward to some videos that aren't 3+ months old.</p>

<p>So here is my first of many Overwatch videos. I am totally addicted to the game and have been playing it as often as I can.</p>

<p>I do apologise for the the slightly less than great quality, I have been playing around with OBS and still haven't found the perfect setting yet.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy the new video and I plan on keeping up-to-date with the recordings.</p>
